Let's have a social networking meetup next week to discuss the latest developments in the cryptocurrency and peer-to-peer world!

We'll have a couple of lightning talks (10 minutes or less per talk) on various peer-to-peer projects. We'll be focusing on projects that have at least a demo, a working prototype or a live application.

Here is a list of projects that [Francis Brunelle](https://frabrunelle.com/) is proposing we should discuss:

* [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)
* [SAFE Network](https://safenetwork.org/)
* [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)
* [ipfs.pics](https://ipfs.pics/)
* [ZeroNet](https://zeronet.io/)
* [LBRY](https://lbry.io/)
* [OpenBazaar](https://openbazaar.org/)
* [Augur](https://augur.net/)
* [Datt](http://datt.co/) + [Yours](http://yours.press/)

Other projects we could discuss:

- [OpenLedger](https://www.openledger.info/) (suggested by [Pascal Ngu Cho](https://twitter.com/webpasco))
