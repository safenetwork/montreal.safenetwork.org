This meetup is inspired by the [Decentralized Web Summit](http://www.decentralizedweb.net/), an event that took place at the Internet Archive on June 8, 2016.

> The current Web is not private or censorship-free. It lacks a memory, a way to preserve our cultureâ€™s digital record through time. The Decentralized Web aims to make the Web open, secure and free of censorship by distributing data, processing, and hosting across millions of computers around the world, with no centralized control.

[Many projects](http://www.decentralizedweb.net/learn-more/#science-fair) are working on making the Decentralized Web a reality. Let's discuss some of them!
