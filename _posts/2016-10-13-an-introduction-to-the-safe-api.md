Let's learn **how to build apps for the SAFE Network**!

The [SAFE Network](https://safenetwork.org/) is a decentralized data storage and communications network that provides a secure, efficient and no-cost infrastructure for app developers.

Here are some examples of open source apps that have been built using the REST API exposed by [SAFE Launcher](https://maidsafe.readme.io/docs/launcher):

* [SAFE Demo App](https://apps.safenetwork.org/safe-demo-app/)
* [SAFE Beaker Browser](https://apps.safenetwork.org/safe-beaker-browser/)
* [SAFE Mail Tutorial](https://apps.safenetwork.org/safe-mail-tutorial/)
* [SafeEditor](https://apps.safenetwork.org/safeeditor/)
* [SafeNote](https://apps.safenetwork.org/safenote/)

### Presentations

[David](https://github.com/davidmtl) will first explain what SAFE Launcher is and why developers should use it. He will then present the high-level APIs (Authorization, NFS and DNS) exposed by SAFE Launcher. He will also demo 2 apps he built: SafeEditor and SafeNote.

[Francis](https://github.com/frabrunelle) will first explain the new low-level APIs (Structured Data, Immutable Data, Appendable Data and Data Identifier) exposed by SAFE Launcher. He will then present the first 2 tutorials of the [SAFE Dev Tutorials](https://tutorials.safedev.org/) series. He will also talk about the new [SAFE API Docs](https://api.safedev.org/) website.

Both presentations will be in French.
